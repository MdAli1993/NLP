# Natural Language Processing

This collection showcases various Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects and experiments, demonstrating the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems.

## ðŸ§ª Projects Overview

This repository contains the following projects:

* **`nlp_basics.py`**: Core NLP examples including tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming/lemmatization, etc.
* **`spam_classifier.py`**: A simple spam detection model using classic machine learning algorithms.
* **`fake_news_classifier_using_lstm.py`**: Fake news detection using an LSTM neural network.
* **`fake_news_classifier_with_ML_using_nlp.py`**: Fake news detection using traditional machine learning techniques with NLP features.
* **`stock_sentimental_classifier.py`**: Sentiment analysis of stock-related news headlines.
* **`stock_price_prediction_and_forecasting_using_stacked_LSTM.py`**: Predicting and forecasting stock prices using stacked LSTM models.
* **`word2vec.py`**: Building and using word embeddings with Word2Vec for sms spam classification.
* **`word_embedding_using_keras.py`**: Generating word embeddings using Keras.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run these projects locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MdAli1993/NLP.git
   cd NLP
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install gensim keras matplotlib nltk numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow tqdm
   ```

### Running a Project

To run a specific project, use:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

For example:

```bash
python spam_classifier.py
```
